## Admissions Rates (from High School)

### Glossary:

* **Applicants**: Number of students who apply
* **Admitted Students**: Number of students who receive an offer (does not mean they accept)
* **Registered Students**: Number of students who accept an offer, and register in classes
* **Admit Rate**: % of applicants who receive an offer (does not mean they accept)
* **Yield Rate**: % of applicants who register__

Some programs have unusually high admit rates, but few of the actual students who receive offers actually end up registering (low yield rates). Sauder, International Economics, Forestry and Engineering are the programs most prone to this. This generally (but does not always mean) that your chances of receiving an offer in a later round (i.e. not early admissions) are much higher.

This is for a variety of reasons, but generally this implies that this program is viewed as a backup program (in case their first few choices don't work out). For example, the Bachelor of International Economics (BIE) program attracts high performing students, but only a third of students that receive offers end up registering in BIE. This could be because students that are able to acquire a first-round offer in BIE are typically strong candidates for more competitive programs (e.g. Ivy League, uChicago, UofT), and therefore, most students are admitted from the last admissions rounds (after the first few rounds of offers are rejected or rescinded in favour of getting into or getting off the waitlist for better universities).

\* No, Sauder does not have a 6% admissions rate. This is a myth from an uncited Tumblr post from the early 2010s, listing a bunch of random "competitive" university programs in Canada, that was later reblogged by [Yahoo News.](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/weather/blogs/insight/the-5-toughest-undergrad-programs-in-canada-to-get-210150421.html)  If anyone tells you Sauder has a 6% admissions rate, they are either lying to you or struggle with basic math and common sense.

\** Yes, these numbers are not wrong. There was a huge drop in new BComm student enrollment in 2020 (total 470 new students, which includes post-secondary transfers and high school transfers). However, the overall class size remained the same as with previous years, indicating that nearly all internal transfers to Sauder were approved in 2020. Enrollment stabilized the following year using traditional admissions streams.

## Taking Summer Courses as an Incoming First-Year Student

If you have already gotten your offer of admission and are planning on starting university early:

1. Accept UBC's offer of admission and pay the non-refundable acceptance deposit.
2. Contact UBC Admissions at admissions.inquiry@ubc.ca to confirm whether or not you are a) admitted for the Summer 2020 session AND b) eligible to enroll in Summer term classes. Certain faculties/schools do not allow this (e.g. Commerce due to STTs). Make sure to state that you are keen on starting your studies earlier than September in your inquiry e-mail.
3. If you are confirmed to be eligible, pay your summer registration deposit.
4. Register for first-year courses with general seats on your registration date. All incoming first-year students have the same registration date: Fri, Mar 6. You have a specific registration time based on your high school GPA; it indicates the earliest time you can register for courses. To find it, go to the UBC Course Schedule page. Make sure the "Session" is set to "2020 Summer." Go to "Program" on the top bar. View the "Eligibilities for session 2020S" for your time. Register as soon as that time comes, as spots fill up fast. You do not need to pay the tuition fee at the time of registration; the deadline is not until you actually begin taking the course.

Note 1: You can take courses in Term 1, in Term 2, or in both; just make sure that you fulfill the prerequisite high school course credits. Contact your Enrolment Service Advisor by phone or e-mail if you are unsure if you meet specific requirements. They may refer you to the specific department for more information. Mention that you were admitted (by the Admissions Office) into the summer 2020 session.

Note 2: If you have any issues along this process, contact u/zwischenimmerundnie, who successfully did this in 2018 summer.
