# 📕 Textbooks

Textbook companies often have business practices that force students to pay large amounts while already on a tight budget. While some courses have switched to more equitable and affordable models, such as open learning materials, some of your classes may still have expensive and/or unethical practices.

Here are some tips on how to handle textbooks in university.

### ☑️ TIP 1: NEVER buy books ahead of time

In some classes, the book actually is an invaluable resource. You can see the **[Hall of Fame](https://communityubc.github.io/ubcwiki/academics/classes/textbooks.html#-hall-of-fame)** section below for some examples. However, with most classes you will find that you don't actually use the textbook. In some cases, the professor will TELL you that you don't need it sometime in the first week.

Sometimes you will need to buy a specific version of the book, you will need some special online access, or it might be cheaper buying from a particular source. When in doubt, it's always best to wait for the first week of classes.

### ☑️ TIP 2: Find a PDF or EPUB of the textbook

Even if you ultimately get the physical book, a PDF is super handy for if you don't have your book with you. It's also often *free*.

> **Places to look for books**
> * [Library Genesis](https://libgen.is/): Most commonly recommended place for finding textbooks
> * [Mobilism](https://forum.mobilism.org/viewforum.php): Has some books that you might not find on LibGen. You may need to make an account to see the book section.
> * [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/): Full texts of books or individual stories in the public domain. All files can be accessed for free under an open format layout

If you are looking for research papers, there's a similar section on the [📜 Research page](../research.md).

### ☑️ TIP 3: Try to buy books second hand

Most students want to get rid of their books once the term is over. Below are some places you can buy and sell your textbooks.

NOTE: Sometimes a course or publisher will have shady practices that force students to buy new textbooks every term. This can include restructuring, renumbering pages/questions, or unnecessary online components. See TIP 1, even when buying second hand.

## 😞 Hall of Shame

These are courses where the textbook is expensive, unethical, and/or not useful for the course. This section is intended to highlight some courses that have been called out for their textbook practices, and hopefully encourage them to change.

One of the easiest ways that a course can improve is by making the textbook optional, or providing
