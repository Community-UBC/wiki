# 👟 Places to visit & Things to do
---
<!-- toc -->

> *The ages old, traditional questions of what to do/where to go/must-see sights/hidden gems/bucket list items haunts the UBC community every year, asked by every person new to UBC, from incoming freshman/transfer/exchange students to visitors, and even old seasoned students who just never took/had the time to look around. Here's your answer to those questions.*
> 
> *I created this a couple of years ago and have sporadically updated it since, so it's by no means a comprehensive list, but hopefully serves some people well. If anyone has additions, I'll try to keep this updated and this will also be one of the resources in the r/UBC wiki. I also wanted to note that this is not my work alone. Along with my own suggestions, I've compiled ideas from friends and other people that I've seen from other r/UBC threads, so thank you everyone.*
