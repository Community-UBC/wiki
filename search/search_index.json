It's also often free.</p> <p>3 - Try to buy books second hand</p> <p>Most students want to get rid of their books once the term is over.

It now likely uses your overall GPA, among over factors. You will get an email with your registration time, and you can confirm the details on Workday. </p> <p>See the following links:</p> <ul> <li>students.ubc.ca/enrolment/registration/registration-dates</li> <li>students.ok.ubc.ca/ws-tutorial/viewing-your-registration-appointment</li> </ul> \u26a0\ufe0fNEW CHANGES - Prerequisites\u26a0\ufe0f How does Workday handle prereqs? <p>In the past, some courses were set up with 'soft' prerequisites, where students could register for a course but would receive an email from the department once they check the list. </p> <p>This is no longer the case for most courses, and so Workday will NOT let you register if it thinks you do not meet the prerequisites.

If successful, the department may do some (or none!) of the following:</p> <ul> <li>before your registration date: add an override to your account so you can register</li> <li>after your date: register you, or backdate your waitlist position to an earlier date</li> </ul> \u26a0\ufe0fNEW CHANGES - Waitlists\u26a0\ufe0f If the course section is full, what should I do? <p>In the past, it was possible to 'jump the waitlist' and register for a course, if you noticed that there was a spot open. Students could use monitoring services to do this more easily. This is no longer the case.</p> Why was this possible? <p>In the SSC, \"waitlist\" sections were actually just regular sections that were titled \"waitlist\". Someone would need to periodically go in and move students from the waitlist into the actual section.</p> <p>Workday has an actual waitlist system:</p> <ul> <li>You will automatically be put in the waitlist if the registration fails.</li> <li>When a spot opens up, it will offer it to the first waitlisted student that meets the seat's requirements. Seats that are restricted to a specific group (ex. a certain specialization) will be offered to the next student that meets that requirement.</li> <li>After the offer, the student has 24 hours to respond, before it is offered to the next student.</li> </ul> <p>Other important changes:</p> <ul> <li>You can register for multiple waitlists for the same course or section type</li> <li>You can register for a waitlist even if it conflicts with something else</li> <li>If a course requires a secondary section (ex. lab, discussion, etc.), you MUST register for one when you register for the lecture section.</li> </ul> <p>Things that are still true:</p> <ul> <li>If you are near graduation and need a course to graduate, reach out to your department.
