    Hi! I'm a commuter student who knows how difficut it can be to find a convenient microwave on campus, especially on days where time is short. I made this map to help you locate the nearest public microwave. Plus, anyone can contribute to the dataset so the information should stay accurate and up-to-date.
    
### How to add microwaves to the map?

1. Open the spreadsheet using the link above.
2. If you want to add a new microwave to the map or edit an existing point, simply make a comment with your changes in 'Sheet1', so spreadsheet moderators can accept the update.

### What can you add?

- To add a point you must provide map coordinates, which can be found here: [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/) or by clicking on a location using a site like Google Maps.
- Please try to add other information like:
    - Number of microwaves at the location
    - Building name of the location
    - Description of how to get to the microwave
    - Any relevant notes
    - Building hours
    - The date of your update (so future viewers can guage the information accuracy)								
- Microwaves must be PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE. No staff room/ residence floor/ private club room locations please!
