!!! tip "Memorable Links"

    Need to find something on campus, but didn't bookmark the wiki page? Use this common format: 
    
    ```
    ubcwiki.ca/campus/find/____
    ```

    For example: [ubcwiki.ca/campus/find/**showers**/](../campus/find/showers.md)

    We currently have pages for:

    - [/**lockers**/](../campus/find/lockers.md)

    Remember, you can always use the search bar to find everything else!
