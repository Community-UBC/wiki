- :simple-reddit: __Reddit Community (r/UBC)__

    **Link:** [https://reddit.com/r/UBC/](https://reddit.com/r/ubc)
    
    This community on Reddit has grown to support over 90,000 users (as of 2024). These users include students, professors, staff, and other community members.

 <!-- The subreddit is not private, there is a bug with shields.io badges. -->

- :simple-lemmy: __Lemmy Community (c/UBC)__

    ---

    **Link:** [https://lemmy.ca/c/ubc](https://lemmy.ca/c/ubc)

    After Reddit made harmful changes in 2023, a backup community was created. This decentralized and open-source alternative, managed by a non-profit, will guarantee that the UBC community has a space to connect, share, and discuss.
