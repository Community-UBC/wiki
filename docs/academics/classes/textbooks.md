Textbook companies often have business practices that force students to pay large amounts while already on a tight budget. While some courses have switched to more equitable and affordable models, such as open learning materials, some of your classes may still have expensive and/or unethical practices.

Here are some tips for getting textbooks.

!!! tip "1 - NEVER buy books ahead of time"

    In some classes, the book actually is an invaluable resource. You can see the **Hall of Fame** section below for some examples. However, with most classes you will find that you don't actually use the textbook. In some cases, the professor will TELL you that you don't need it sometime in the first week.

    Sometimes you will need to buy a specific version of the book, you will need some special online access, or it might be cheaper buying from a particular source. When in doubt, it's always best to wait for the first week of classes.

!!! tip "2 - Find a PDF or EPUB of the textbook"

    Even if you ultimately get the physical book, a PDF is super handy for if you don't have your book with you. It's also often *free*.

!!! tip "3 - Try to buy books second hand"

    Most students want to get rid of their books once the term is over. Below you can find some places to buy and sell your textbooks.
