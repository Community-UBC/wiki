# UBC Community Wiki Project

The UBCWiki was initially started by moderators of the /r/UBC subreddit. It has since been moved to Github pages to allow for easier collaboration and a much nicer platform to work with.

If you would like to commit changes directly, see the [installation guide](./project) for instructions on how to grab the project.
