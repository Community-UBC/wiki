## History

The r/UBC Reddit community has been around since May 06, 2009, and has since grown to have tens of thousands of users, including students, professors, staff, and other community members. 

In June 11 2023, after Reddit made changes to their API which limited access to the site and limited tools used for moderation and accesibility, we created a backup community on a local instance of Lemmy (the federated Reddit alternative). This backup community is managed by the same team from r/UBC, and it is available for any users that would like to use it. Should there be any issues with Reddit in the future, this backup community is the place to regroup and discuss. 

Later that same year, this wiki website was officially launched 🥳

Don't [harass](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/10jwcza/comment/j5ndjji/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) a TA by emailing them.

        > 
        > A little bit about myself: In grade 9 I failed math 9 and science 9 and was going to drop out of school because I thought I was too dumb for school. But there was a girl I had a crush on and I wanted to impress her so I started learning how to study and how to improve in school, and after a year I raised my average a lot. Over the years I've learned how to study better, and teach other students/clients how to raise their grades as well.
