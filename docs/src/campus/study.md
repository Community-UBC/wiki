# Study Spots

::: info /u/chilylugia

*This might be my last year at UBC, so my partner encouraged me to study at every single building on campus! (since Iâ€™ve only pretty much studied at the biology building for the past few years LOOOL)*

*I hope that this will also encourage yâ€™all to check out different buildings for study spots as well!*
