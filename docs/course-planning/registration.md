Course scheduling is a nightmare and the SSC loves to ruin your day. Here are some tips and tools to make it better.

##  	

!!! question "Registration FAQ"

    __When will I know my registration time?__

    You will know around 2 weeks before the registration. Your time will be within a range according to your year level, and you can find that [range here](https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/registration/registration-dates). This time can change in some cases so check the SSC again in the days before registration opens.

    <br>

    __How is registration time calculated exactly?__

    *TODO: Work in progress*

    <br>

    __I didnâ€™t get a seat in the course I wanted. What should I do?__

    1. You should first sign up for the waitlist and register for your backup course. 

    2. Many students will also sign up for notification services linked below, which will notify you when a seat opens up. If you do use this method, try to log in as soon as you get a notification or else someone else may grab the seat. Please also note that these methods only work if your course is open for registration as some courses will block off registration so only the course coordinator can move people in from the waitlist manually. If this is the case, DO NOT leave your waitlist as you will lose your spot in the list. 

    3. If you still have not gotten into your course when classes start, show up to the class anyways and speak to the prof. They will often be able to find you a spot, or they will let you know if it will not be possible. This is a tried and true method that has worked for many students.
